RabbitMQ:

Workflows, Retries, and Delayed Publishing: RabbitMQ excels in managing complex workflows, supporting message retries, and facilitating delayed message publishing. It ensures reliable message persistence and offers robust features for handling various messaging patterns.


Redis:

Lightweight and Fast Queuing: Redis is renowned for its lightweight architecture and rapid queuing capabilities. While it provides high-speed operations, its default configuration lacks persistence, making it more suitable for scenarios where transient data is acceptable. Enabling Append-Only File (AOF) persistence and utilizing sorted sets can introduce delays, but this may impact performance.


Kafka:

Event-Driven Architecture and High Scalability: Kafka is designed for event-driven architectures, offering high scalability and throughput. However, it comes with increased complexity in implementation and is typically employed in large-scale applications where durable message storage and real-time data processing are critical.
