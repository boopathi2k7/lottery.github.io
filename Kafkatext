[03/03, 10:42 am] Sridhar BOA: Summary of AOF (Append-Only File) in Redis

AOF is a persistence mechanism in Redis that logs every write operation to a file, ensuring durability and data recovery after a restart. It appends commands sequentially and replays them to restore the database state.

Key Features:

Durability: Ensures data is not lost after a restart.

Flushing Strategies: Can sync writes always, everysec (default), or no (OS-controlled).

Rewrite Mechanism: Periodically compacts the log to optimize performance.


Pros & Cons:

✅ Pros: Reliable persistence, human-readable logs, configurable sync settings.
❌ Cons: Larger file size, slower recovery, higher disk I/O.
[03/03, 10:44 am] Sridhar BOA: Key Takeaways:

Redis and Kafka ensure ordering within partitions, not globally.

RabbitMQ maintains FIFO per queue, making it more reliable for strict ordering.
[03/03, 10:45 am] Sridhar BOA: Key Takeaways:

Redis: Single-threaded but can handle concurrent requests via I/O multiplexing.

Kafka: Uses partitions to allow concurrent consumers.

RabbitMQ: Uses queues with multiple consumers for concurrent processing.
[03/03, 10:48 am] Sridhar BOA: Message Delay (TTL & Scheduling) Comparison: Redis vs. Kafka vs. RabbitMQ

Key Takeaways:

Redis: Delays messages using Sorted Sets but depends on memory limits.

Kafka: Supports long-term retention (days to weeks) via log retention settings.

RabbitMQ: Uses TTL or delayed exchanges but not suitable for very long delays.


Would you like a Java example demonstrating delayed message processing in any of these?

|-----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Delay Mechanism** | Sorted Sets (`ZADD` with timestamps) or Streams | Retention policy & scheduled messages (log retention) | TTL (per message/queue) or delayed exchange |
| **Maximum Delay** | No strict limit (depends on memory) | Configurable (typically days/weeks based on retention settings) | Configurable (varies based on TTL settings) |
| **Guaranteed Retention** | Until manually removed or memory limit reached | Based on retention policy (logs can be retained for days/weeks) | Messages expire once TTL is reached |
| **Best Use Case** | Short-term delays, job scheduling | Long-term storage & scheduled delivery | Short/medium delays for task execution |
