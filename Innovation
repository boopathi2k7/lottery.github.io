Slide 1 â€“ Introduction & Objective

ThreadSentinel is an AI-powered cybersecurity platform that unifies customer interactions across all channels â€” phone, chat, email, and branch.

It provides a real-time severity score (0â€“100) to assess urgency and risk.

Based on severity, it dynamically triggers actions like OTP verification, MFA, or fraud team escalation to prevent losses and build customer trust.

Slide 2 â€“ Current Challenges (BOA-Specific)

Customers face repeated issues because support channels are disconnected.

There is poor coordination between support and fraud teams, leading to long account lockout times.

Fraud is a major concern: $290M+ in losses and 210K+ complaints, especially with delayed resolutions in scams like Zelle.

Slide 3 â€“ Key Innovation

Every issue is assigned a real-time severity score on a 0â€“100 scale.

AI + rules-based action layer adapts responses: Low â†’ normal resolution, Medium â†’ OTP, High â†’ MFA with senior agents, Critical â†’ fraud team alert + temporary lock.

This creates a unified issue thread across all touchpoints, ensuring faster and consistent resolutions.

Customer Experience â†’ Seamless, transparent process with no repetition of information.

Agent Efficiency â†’ Complete case history, smart actions, faster resolution.

Regulatory Readiness â†’ Stronger audit trails and CFPB compliance support.

Would you like me to also highlight which points to emphasize (bold/voice stress) so you sound more confident while presenting?
