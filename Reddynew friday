1. Start Redis Server on a Specific Port

By default, Redis runs on port 6379. If you want to use a different port, follow these steps:

Step 1: Open a Command Prompt and Start Redis

Navigate to the Redis installation folder and run:

redis-server --port 6380

This starts Redis on port 6380.

Step 2: Verify Redis is Running

Open another terminal and run:

redis-cli -p 6380

Type:

PING

If Redis is running, it will respond with:

PONG

2. Use Redis as a Message Queue

Now, let's use Redis Lists (LPUSH and RPOP) as a message queue.

Step 1: Open Redis CLI

Run:

redis-cli -p 6380

Step 2: Push Messages to Queue (Producer)

LPUSH myqueue "Message 1"
LPUSH myqueue "Message 2"

LPUSH → Adds messages to the queue (myqueue).


Step 3: Retrieve Messages from Queue (Consumer)

RPOP myqueue

RPOP → Removes and retrieves a message.


Now, you've successfully implemented a basic message queue in Redis.

3. Configure Redis Port Permanently

If you want Redis to always run on port 6380, follow these steps:

Step 1: Modify Redis Configuration File

1. Find redis.windows.conf in your Redis installation folder.


2. Open it with Notepad or any text editor.


3. Find the line:

# port 6379


4. Change it to:

port 6380


5. Save the file.



Step 2: Start Redis with the New Config

Run:

redis-server redis.windows.conf

Now, Redis always runs on port 6380.

4. Use Redis MQ with Spring Boot

If you want to connect Spring Boot to Redis running on port 6380, update application.properties:

spring.redis.host=localhost
spring.redis.port=6380

5. What Happens If Redis Goes Down?

Messages stay in the queue until Redis is restarted.

If Redis crashes, unprocessed messages are lost (unless persistence is enabled).

To enable persistence, use:

redis-server --appendonly yes
