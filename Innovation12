ThreadSentinel – 2–3 Minute Speech

“Good [morning/afternoon], I’m here to present ThreadSentinel – an AI-powered cross-channel resolution and risk-aware response platform designed for Bank of America.”

“Today, customers interact with us through multiple channels — phone, chat, email, and branches — but these interactions often remain disconnected. This leads to repeated customer issues, poor coordination between support and fraud teams, long wait times during account lockouts, and even delayed resolutions in scams like Zelle. As a result, the bank faces over $290 million in fraud losses and more than 210,000 customer complaints.”

“ThreadSentinel solves this by creating a unified issue thread across all channels, powered by AI severity scoring on a 0–100 scale. Each issue is analyzed in real-time, and based on the score, the system dynamically triggers the right security action — from normal resolution, to OTP verification, to MFA with senior agents, or even immediate fraud team escalation with account lock if critical.”

*“The impact for BOA is significant:

Fraud Prevention by stopping high-risk cases before financial loss.

Better Customer Experience with seamless, transparent, and faster resolutions.

Agent Efficiency through complete issue history and smart action triggers.

Regulatory Readiness with stronger audit trails and compliance support.”*


“In short, ThreadSentinel reduces fraud, improves trust, and transforms cross-channel issue resolution into a smarter, faster, and safer process for our customers and for BOA.”
