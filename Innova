🔍 Problem Statement (Specific to Bank of America – 2024/2025)

Despite significant digital investments, Bank of America continues to face customer dissatisfaction and regulatory pressure due to fragmented support experiences and escalating fraud events, especially via Zelle and mobile channels.

Key Issues:

❌ Customers repeatedly explain issues across app, chat, phone, or branch

❌ Account lockouts and outages with little transparency

❌ Delayed or denied fraud resolutions

❌ Poor handoff between fraud/dispute teams and support

❌ Weak proactive fraud detection, especially during social engineering scams

📊 Verified Real-World Impact

> 🧾 Zelle Fraud Crisis (Source: CFPB, CBS, FT, 2024)



210,000+ Bank of America customers filed Zelle-related fraud complaints

~$290 million in customer-reported losses

Lawsuit filed by CFPB against BofA (and others) over failure to reimburse fraud victims


> 📈 Consumer Complaints (2024 Data)



3,170+ complaints related to checking/savings accounts in 2024 alone (via CFPB)

Reports of users being locked out of accounts for days or months

Widely reported $0 balance glitches and card blocks affecting mobile and ATM access

These figures highlight a systemic issue in cross-channel coordination, fraud prevention, and customer trust.

💡 Proposed Solution

> A Bank of America–specific AI-powered system that unifies support threads and dynamically adjusts responses based on real-time issue scoring.



Core Idea:

> One continuous issue thread across all support channels (chat, phone, app, branch), enhanced with an AI-based severity score that determines what level of verification or escalation is needed — before customer frustration or fraud loss occurs.

🛠️ System Components

🔁 1. Cross-Channel Issue Threading

Stitch together every interaction from app, chat, IVR, and branch into a single case ID

Agents and customers both view complete conversation history


🤖 2. AI-Based Severity Scoring Engine

Inputs include:

Customer tier (Platinum/Gold/Standard)

NLP-based sentiment (e.g., frustration, panic)

Channel used (chat < phone < branch)

Reopen history or delay duration

Transaction context (e.g., Zelle amount, location mismatch)



🔐 3. Dynamic Risk-Based Response Flow

Score Range	Severity Level	Automated System Response

0–30	Low	Track issue, assign SLA to resolve
31–50	Moderate	Trigger OTP verification for access
51–70	High	Enforce MFA, assign issue to fraud queue
71–100	Critical	Immediate fraud escalation, lock account, notify team


✅ This empowers early detection of fraud, proactive customer verification, and faster handoffs — preventing Zelle-type financial losses and long wait times.
