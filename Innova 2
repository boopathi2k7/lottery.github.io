Got it 👍 I’ll enrich your speaking points with a real-time example and a strong closing line so judges remember your pitch.

Slide 1 – Introduction & Objective

ThreadSentinel is an AI-powered cybersecurity platform that unifies customer interactions across all channels — phone, chat, email, and branch.

It provides a real-time severity score (0–100) to assess urgency and risk.

Based on severity, it dynamically triggers actions like OTP verification, MFA, or fraud team escalation to prevent losses and build customer trust.

Slide 2 – Current Challenges (BOA-Specific)

Customers face repeated issues because support channels are disconnected.

There is poor coordination between support and fraud teams, leading to long account lockout times.

Fraud is a major concern: $290M+ in losses and 210K+ complaints, especially with delayed resolutions in scams like Zelle.

Slide 3 – Key Innovation (with Example)

Every issue is assigned a real-time severity score on a 0–100 scale.

AI + rules-based action layer adapts responses: Low → normal resolution, Medium → OTP, High → MFA with senior agents, Critical → fraud team alert + temporary lock.

Example: Imagine a customer reports suspicious Zelle activity. Instead of waiting for manual fraud review, ThreadSentinel instantly scores it as “High Risk,” triggers MFA for account verification, and alerts the fraud team in real time — preventing potential loss within seconds.

Slide 4 – Why It Matters to BOA

Fraud Prevention → Stops high-risk cases before they turn into financial losses.

Customer Experience → Seamless, transparent process with no repetition of information.

Agent Efficiency → Complete case history, smart actions, faster resolution.

Regulatory Readiness → Stronger audit trails and CFPB compliance support.

Strong Closing Line

“ThreadSentinel is not just about reducing fraud — it’s about transforming the way Bank of America protects customers. By combining AI, security, and seamless support, we ensure banking is not only smarter and faster, but also safer and more trusted.”

👉 With this flow, you’ll have impact + example + strong close, which judges usually score high on.

Would you like me to also time your script into a 3-minute delivery breakdown (slide-by-slide seconds) so you don’t overshoot in presentation?
