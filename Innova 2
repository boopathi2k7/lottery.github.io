🧠 Idea Summary – ThreadSentinel

“AI-Powered Cross-Channel Resolution & Risk-Aware Response for Bank of America”


---

📝 Overview:

ThreadSentinel is an AI-driven platform designed for Bank of America to unify support interactions across all channels — phone, app, chat, email, and branch — into a single, real-time issue thread.

It uses AI-based severity scoring to assess the urgency and risk of every issue, and dynamically triggers security actions like OTP, MFA, or fraud team escalation, reducing fraud losses and enhancing customer trust.

🎯 Problem It Solves (BOA-Specific):

Customers repeat issues across disconnected support channels

Poor handoff between support and fraud teams

Long wait times during account lockouts

Delayed or denied resolutions in Zelle-related scams

$290M+ in fraud losses reported, 210K+ customer complaints



---

💡 Key Innovation:

Real-time severity score per issue (0–100 scale)

Unified issue thread across all touchpoints

AI + rules-based action layer that adapts:

Low score → normal resolution

Medium → OTP verification

High → MFA + senior agent assignment

Critical → Fraud team alert + temporary lock
